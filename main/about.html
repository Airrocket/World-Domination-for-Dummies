            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Game Design by Idiots is a website made by me with some stupid games and experiments in JS.<br><br>
            This project originally started when some friends and I were playing a board game on the last day of 7th grade.
            (Unfortunately none of us remember what it was called.)
            We didn't pay attention to the rules and turned it into "Global Communism Simulator".
            I started out just wanting to make this game, but then expanded my goal to include making
            my own website as well as some other games.<p>
